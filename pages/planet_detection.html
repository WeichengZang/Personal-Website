	            <p>A figure for exoplanets from different exoplanet-detection methods. Microlensing preferentially detects planets with periods longer than 1 yr and has sensitivity to planets extending into the outer parts of their stellar systems including free-floating planets (FFPs). The <strong>filled magenta points</strong> show the 42 planets discovered by the two projects led by me, including most of the lowest mass-ratio planets and the first terrestrial planet with periods as long as Saturnâ€™s. </p>
 


										
										<h2><strong>The Gravitational Microlensing Technique</strong></h2>

                    <p>If there is a foreground lens star transiting the line of sight, due to the general relativity, the light of the background source star will be refracted and then we can receive more flux from the source star. The typical angular Einstein radius of microlensing events is ~0.5 mas, so now it is almost impossible to resolve the microlensing images, and what we observe is a symmetric, non-repeating, and single-peak light curve. If one of the lensing images passes by or is close to a planet around the lens star, the planet can produce a perturbation on the light curve. In the left panel, the planet induces a short-lived bump after the main peak. </p>
